Making input and output class-level variables can simplify the code and make it more organized, especially for competitive programming where you often need to access these streams across multiple methods. This approach can help avoid passing the streams as parameters and make the code cleaner.
Hereâ€™s an updated version of the C# competitive programming template with input and output as class-level variables:
C# Competitive Programming Template with Class-Level Variables
C#
```
using System;
using System.IO;

class CPTemplate
{
    private static StreamReader input;
    private static StreamWriter output;

    static void Main()
    {
        using (input = new StreamReader(Console.OpenStandardInput()))
        using (output = new StreamWriter(Console.OpenStandardOutput()) { AutoFlush = false })
        {
            // Read number of test cases
            int testCases = int.Parse(input.ReadLine());

            for (int t = 0; t < testCases; t++)
            {
                Solve();
            }



            output.Flush();
        }
    }

    static void Solve()
    {
        // Example: Read an integer
        int n = int.Parse(input.ReadLine());

        // Example: Read an array of integers
        string[] tokens = input.ReadLine().Split(' ');
        int[] array = Array.ConvertAll(tokens, int.Parse);

        //Write the logic here


        output.WriteLine("Write the output");
    }

}

```
** Explanation: **


Class-Level Variables:

input and output are declared as static class-level variables. This makes them accessible throughout the class without needing to pass them as parameters.



Main Method:

Initializes the input and output streams.
Reads the number of test cases.
Calls the Solve method for each test case.
Ensures all output is flushed at the end.



Solve Method:

This method is called for each test case.
Reads input specific to the test case.
Processes the input and computes the result.
Writes the result to the output.



ProcessData Method:

This is a placeholder method where you can implement the logic for processing the input data.
In this example, it simply calculates the sum of an array of integers.



Benefits of Class-Level Variables:

Simplified Method Signatures: Methods like Solve do not need to accept StreamReader and StreamWriter as parameters, making the method signatures cleaner.
Ease of Access: The input and output streams are easily accessible from any method within the class, reducing the need to pass them around.
Centralized Resource Management: Initialization and disposal of the streams are handled in one place (the Main method), making resource management more straightforward.

Example Usage:
If you have an input like this:
Unknown2
3
1 2 3
4
4 5 6 7

The Solve method will be called twice, once for each test case. The first call will process the input 3 and 1 2 3, and the second call will process the input 4 and 4 5 6 7.
Customization:

Multiple Methods: You can add more methods as needed to organize your code better.
Data Structures: Use appropriate data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries) based on the problem requirements.
Error Handling: Add error handling as needed, especially for edge cases and invalid input.

This template provides a solid starting point for competitive programming in C#. You can customize it further based on your specific needs and preferences.
